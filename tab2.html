      <h2> Central Processing Unit / CPU </h2>
      <p> A CPU is a short term for Central Processing Unit. It can also be called as processor which is a chip that act as the brain of a computer or any other devices as it can be part in any devices. It performs operation or outputting information based on the received input from peripherals or computer program. As its uses is stated above, a device will never work without a CPU.</p>

      <h2> Motherboard </h2>
      <p> The motherboard is the backbone that ties the computer's components together at one spot and allows them to talk to each other. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact. Total motherboard functionality is necessary for a computer to work well. While you don’t need to peek inside your computer to look at the motherboard on a regular basis, it’s smart to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of this essential tool. The motherboard will look like a piece of flat cardboard or plastic with lots of metal designs and wires on and around it.</p>

      <h2> Random Access Memory / RAM </h2>
      <p> Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory, which it uses to handle all active tasks and apps. None of your programs, files, games, or streams would work without RAM. RAM is short for “random access memory” and while it might sound mysterious, RAM is one of the most fundamental elements of computing. RAM is the super-fast and temporary data storage space that a computer needs to access right now or in the next few moments.

      <p> Power Supplies are one of the very important PC hardware component. This is used for distributing or supplying power to the pc which convert AC volts into a low steady voltage DC. The power supply have ratings which are the following; 80 PLUS, 
      80 PLUS Bronze, 80 PLUS Silver, 80 PLUS Gold, 80 PLUS Platinum, and 80 PLUS Titanium being the most efficient and most expensive. These ratings will tell the efficiency of the power supply. </p>

      <h2> Graphics Processing Unit / GPU </h2>
      <p> A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a computer chip that performs rapid mathematical calculations, primarily for the purpose of rendering images. Because of its parallel processing architecture it is able to render images more quickly than a CPU , which allows it to perform multiple calculations at the same time. A CPU is designed primarily to be an executive and make decisions, as directed by the software whereas GPU have been designed so they are very good at doing video processing, and less executive work</p>

      <p> SSDs or Solid State Drives are 10x faster, more durable, more compact, quieter, and consume less energy while on the other hand, HDDs or Hard Disk Drives are more affordable and may offer easier data recovery in the event of damage but, very old generation and has a slower speed than what an SSD reach. Drives collect and store data. Your documents, pictures, music, videos, programs, application preferences, and operating system represent digital content stored on a hard drive. </p>

      <p> A keyboard is a piece of hardware that allows you to type text into a computer or other electronic device. A keyboard is an input device that allows a user to interface with a computer in the most basic way possible. Although the keys or letters are organized to work as electrical switches, this device is patterned after its predecessor, the typewriter, from which the keyboard got its layout. Punctuation, alphanumeric, and special keys, such as the Windows key and different multimedia keys, are among the keys with specialized functionality.
